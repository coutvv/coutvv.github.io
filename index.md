<h1 class="post-title"> Hello, World! </h1>

I am an calm, modest and a little enlightenment Software Developer who lives in Kazan, Russian Federation. I code for Java Platform and web(js/html/css/obsolescent_frameworks). This is a spot where I post my boring, crazy and stupid ideas and things, like this: 

- VKLiker, bot who like any kind of post in VK feed
- Vergil System – a bot guy, who get me from the depression hell
- Tetris Competition – how fast I can code the famous time killer
- Decimal Time – my shots to turn to french revolutionary time system

That's it.

And sometimes I will be post about my hobby like playing Guitar, cycling, archery. 

Also I just learn English and if you have found any error please let me know via twitter or email!
