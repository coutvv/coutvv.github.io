This series of posts is replaced for my monthly digest and if it will be continued it’s also replace my results in planning desks in trello. And like improvement I can move the whole structure from there to here! And insert the link of the post there! Very nice. If it’ll work…

I tried to release something in my blog on this week. But it’s failed. 

On the work I am creating android app. As I said in the last post [this fatty book](https://www.amazon.com/Busy-Coders-Guide-Android-Development/dp/0981678009) help me. Right now I made just UI. It’s not so difficult as I thought but it requires many efforts. I have 4 more weeks. 

In English learning I discover my totally misunderstanding of spoken language. I already have listened of 290 English podcasts and discover it just this week! What’s wrong with me? I used an hour for recording of just 3 minutes of English Caffe podcast!! The colossal speed! And cause of it I stopped my exercises in grammar and reading and others waste of time to train my listening skills. 


I had getting joy from contrast shower this week. 

I canceled my 4 kilometer running in evening and on the next week I will start to run 1 km in the morning. 

My weekend was boring. I wasn’t in the good mood and just listen the lovely streams about China from Bushwacker. 

I was hated with the small font in the stickers app in MacOS. But it was misunderstood. Small font allow to use many stickers and cover the whole screen of many small piece of text in different colors. This approach show the bigger picture than just use one sticker window. And the awesome feature in macOS with selected text: for create the sticker of selected text just press CMD+SHIFT+Y.

New music:

- [Orchard – Jess Hill](https://jesshill.bandcamp.com/album/orchard). I like the woman vocal, acoustic guitar  and a little sad.
- [On Sunset Lake – Kontiki Suite](https://kontikisuite.bandcamp.com/album/on-sunset-lake). I don’t like pop music but it have something that I get.
- [Midera – After the harvest come the ashes](https://midera.bandcamp.com/album/after-the-harvest-come-the-ashes). When I listened it I remembered soundtracks from Interstellar, Starcraft and so on. 

I really really want to sleep. Here will be shame of me but… that’s all
