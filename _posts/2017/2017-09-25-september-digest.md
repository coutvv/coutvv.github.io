Well well well... This month was a little strange. I translate and public on habrahabr.ru ( and as result -- get invite there ) half of [this](https://joshondesign.com/2017/08/18/idealos_essay) article. And after some time another user posted whole article and I lost motivation to translate another half.

After that I tried Angular 4 with Typescript. It was funny. May be I'll migrate on this version some day. With trying it I had a lot of frightening issues about nodejs dependencies. A lot of piece of sh... But that's OK. 

Bought first app on AppStore. This was sales and it cost about 0.25$ and I decide to tempt appstore payments. Ah, App was [it](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/%D1%81%D1%83%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%8B-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%85%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B7%D0%B0-27-%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B9/id1222860908?mt=8&v0=WWW-EURU-ITSTOP100-PAIDAPPS&l=ru&ign-mpt=uo%3D4). And yes this is so stupid. And I didn't pass it yet. 11 days -- my record

Another case -- I started work with MacOS. Learned some lessons. First of all is "You must to work with that daily". I forget anything. 

And in last: I finished 2 books of great philosopher of stoicism -- Lucius Anney Seneca and the Emperor Mark Aurelius Antoninus:

>When something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no unhappiness; to endure it and prevail is happiness.
