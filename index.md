# Hello World!

My name is **Roman**.
I have been involved in development with JVM technologies for over {{experience}} years.  
I like Linux, Kotlin, IntelliJ IDEA, Vim and simplicity.
I follow the philosophy of the UNIX way.

Here I write about next topics (in English):
- Software Development 
- Architecture Design
- Tips and Tricks for productivity
- Soft skills

Also, I write brief notes about my findings in Russian on
my Telegram channel: [dev highlights](https://t.me/devhighl).

My open-source projects:
- [Xit Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23646-xit-support) - Intellij IDEA
plugin for highlighting [\[x\]it](https://xit.jotaen.net) files.

Glad to see any feedback!
