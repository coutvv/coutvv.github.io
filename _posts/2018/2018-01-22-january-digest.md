I know. I write here really really rare. And this idea with weekly digest may fail very fast. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.

**Android Development**. Finally I started to create a project of mobile app for Android platform. I had no any experience in that, but I thought it’s time to learning! And I suppose to get it after I’ll have read [this 4000-page manual](https://www.amazon.com/Busy-Coders-Guide-Android-Development/dp/0981678009). I have never been so wrong… I was like a blind kitty. Whatever I did, nothing worked. I remembered my first attempts in development games with Java on old mobile phones. Then and now was so similar! 

But with time I got certain result and I suppose that this week was a checkpoint in getting the expertise in android development. Well I hope so…

**History videos**. On the last week I fall in love with streams about history from [bushwaker](https://www.youtube.com/user/ButKorn). I like to playing in Civilization IV and quality history speaker on the background add more joy in this kind of entertainment. Now I listened all about 1st world war and three lectures about Japan. To be continued…

**Health**. I started to get a hot and cold shower for disease prevention. I supposed to get it in the morning but I always late and got it after work. It is very well for cheerfulness and surprisingly this procedure reduces appetite. Addition to my future possible losing weight. 

**Music**. Searching of new music was built very randomly. I had in my playlist music from Yandex-radio, vk feed, movies ost and from unknown youtube/coub videos. I wanted to correct this stupidity and subscribe to [this](http://list.rcrdbox.com) email distribution. They send you every day a few albums and you rate it. For now I get and listened following:
- [Joyya Marie – Some Kind of Love](https://joyyamarie.bandcamp.com/album/some-kind-of-love). R&B, pop-music. I really like vocal part. 
- [Sessionmacher – Luxus](https://sessionmacher.bandcamp.com/album/luxus). German rap, which was for me very exotic sort of music. I like it and think it’s perfect background soundtrack. English and Russian songs divert from thinking. 
- [Better Bidness Bureau – is An Element](https://betterbidnessbureau.bandcamp.com/album/is-an-element). Instrumental, jazz. It’s very well for relaxation.

And this was my fifth week of 2018.
