preview: "OK. Just start to talk about my life in that's language. Well, this month was'nt so english. I skipped some of my daily english podcast listening routine. But I experiment with it. I think I need more effort for essential improvement. For serials -- make out subtitles and repeat difficult moments. For podcasts -- read whole text before listening and learn unknown words."

In August I change this blog. I transfer it to jekyll and free github page hosting. Previous hosting rent has expired and I wanted to change design. So site become more minimalistic!

This month I redesign my planning board. Remove all periodic delay things and enter some rules. I notice that all planning system is not working for me. I need someone with agile frames, permanent changable like algorithm Digital Fortress in Dan Braun's novell. So I forced to reinvent some planning tactic's.

My running achievement reached pike. I ran 12 km throw the forest twice. And my damaged left leg made itself felt. It's not so sad as may seen. Just I discover my running limit and it's possible to expand it. 

Finally, just leave it here:

>You think, I suppose, that it is now in order for me to cite some examples of great men. No, I shall cite rather the case of a boy. The story of the Spartan lad has been preserved: taken captive while still a stripling, he kept crying in his Doric dialect, "I will not be a slave!" and he made good his word; for the very first time he was ordered to perform a menial and degrading service, – and the command was to fetch a chamber-pot, – he dashed out his brains against the wall.

>So near at hand is freedom, and is anyone still a slave? Would you not rather have your own son die thus than reach old age by weakly yielding? Why therefore are you distressed, when even a boy can die so bravely? Suppose that you refuse to follow him; you will be led. Take into your own control that which is now under the control of another. Will you not borrow that boy's courage, and say: "I am no slave!"? Unhappy fellow, you are a slave to men, you are a slave to your business, you are a slave to life. For life, if courage to die be lacking, is slavery.
