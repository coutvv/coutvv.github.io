Hate november. It's too stupid time when snow interwoven with rain. But this year it was not true. End of november was very dry and without anything sign of snow. And it was worse. I like winter and its attribute like snow, even if it mixed with dirt, would be doing this end of fall more kindness than just nude streets.

But this november was the first month of using Macbook Pro. And this computer is so awesome! But after a month all its wow-effect stuff became commonness. I just stop noticing this. You know, like when you have miopia and you start using glasses and then after time the world become more ordinary. But without glasses all around is blur. And I was afraid that without mac I will be hated all other computers but it didn't happened. I get to use apple keyboard and didn't forget about windows shortcuts. 

With getting a Mac I started(or keep on) to learning vim editor. Before I use it for some easy things like edit config or fast fix script on server and then it was just basic skill. Now I enjoy using it and wanna improve this edit skill in vim. In addition, I think learning vim is like blind printing on keyboard skill: you have to break the barrier by everyday exercising and in one day your mind will be working right to the text passing the input devices. It's very awesome feeling!

And the last global skill in my life – English. I hire a tutor and she do her job very well. There is passed three lessons, but I opened for me some good techniq: writing essay, skimming(fast reading), scripting of listening. This type of practice English I never used and I'm waiting the next meeting with impatience.

In my trello week plan was appeared changes. I return to use my first half of year system with checkbox list in front of using labels on every cards. Lazyness won. For setting thing done I need to click on card, then click on labels menu and finally click done label. But next I need to close card for go to other thing. It is so tired. I keep this boring system for appearing tasks. But if it is possible to cut the task to smaller and then organize checkbox list: may be my label system was mistake... Wasting time.
